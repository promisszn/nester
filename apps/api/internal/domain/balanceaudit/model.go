// Package balanceaudit is the append-only ledger of every balance-changing
// vault operation (nester#1124): deposits, withdrawals, harvests, and
// rebalance legs. Kept dependency-free, like domain/moneypath and
// domain/caps, so the service layer and the postgres repository can both
// depend on it without a repository -> service import cycle.
//
// This is deliberately lighter than a full double-entry ledger: one row per
// operation with an explicit before/after balance, not a set of debit/credit
// postings across accounts. That is enough to answer the two questions a
// launch needs answered — "what happened to this user's balance, and does it
// reconcile to what we show them today" — without building ledger machinery
// the team doesn't yet need.
//
// Retention: rows are kept indefinitely; see the comment on the
// balance_audit_log table (migration 107) for the growth-rate rationale.
